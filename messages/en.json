These technologies allow the production of implants with improved performance and longevity. This could lead to the development of more wear-resistant implants that can last for decades, as well as significantly reduce the need for replacement surgeries, improving the quality of life of patients."

        "paraph1": "As the population of modern societies ages and the risk of bone disease or bone accidents increases, the need for a new generation of materials with superior biocompatibility and adequate mechanical properties is a challenge. CoCoA-bio combines two innovative metallurgical concepts to provide a material solution for the intended application, positioning itself on a key public health issue. Indeed, multi-component alloys (HEA/CCA) based on the TiNbZr-X system (X = Mo, Ta) will be produced by additive manufacturing, in particular by selective laser melting (SLM). After each development step by SLM and the optimization of the microstructures by hot isostatic compaction and controlled annealing (WP1), the microstructures of the resulting samples will be fully characterized (WP2) and their mechanical behavior analyzed under different loading conditions, including fatigue (WP3). A step of mechanical functionalization of the surfaces carried out by machining with metrological monitoring (WP4) will be carried out before a chemical functionalization to identify the suitability of the materials developed for the intended application (WP5). Two additional tasks, WP0 (coordination) and WP6",
        "paraph2": "(regulation and socio-economic aspect) will also complete the structure of the proposal, which will last 48 months. In addition to the initial pre-alloyed powders, which will mainly be developed for us as part of an external service, the core of the project is composed of batches WP1, WP4 and WP5, based on the results of batches WP2, WP3 and WP6, which allow us to filter the solution envisaged. Indeed, the architecture of the project was designed to identify several candidate alloys for the desired application, then to converge towards the most promising solution(s), using tools adapted to each task. At the end of the project, a dental implant prototype, chosen as a model product to validate the experimental approach developed, will be proposed. The consortium is convinced that the CoCoA-Bio project will contribute to the requalification of HEAs from promising materials to real candidates to replace currently applied material solutions (for lack of anything better), in our case alloys for bio-implants. The consortium’s cross-expertise and resources on additive manufacturing, HEA design and characterization and their surface functionalization are important assets to achieve the objectives of the CoCoA-Bio proposal."
